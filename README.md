For exploratory data analysis, see [EDA notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/linmayorga/gs_case_study/blob/main/EDA.ipynb)
For customer lifetime value (CLV) ML model, see [CLV ML model notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/linmayorga/gs_case_study/blob/main/CLV%20ML%20models.ipynb)

Using the [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) is recommended for viewing the notebooks, especially to view the EDA one, as the internal notebook links don't seem to work when viewing from Github
When cloning the repo and running the notebook locally however, the links work fine
